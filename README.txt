Introduction
The ToDo List website is a simple and user-friendly application designed to help users manage their daily tasks. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it features a clean and modern design. The goal of the website is to provide users with an efficient and easy-to-use tool to organize their tasks and stay on top of their priorities.

Features:

1.Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to their ToDo list by clicking the "+" icon in the top right corner of the screen. 
A modal will appear, allowing users to enter a title, description, and select tags for their task.

2.Edit Tasks: Users can edit existing tasks by clicking on the task in the ToDo list. 
A modal will appear, allowing users to update the title, description, and tags for their task.

4.Filter Tasks by Tags: Users can filter their ToDo list by clicking on the tags in the sidebar.
Only tasks with the selected tag will be displayed.

5.Hide Done Tasks: Users can hide completed tasks from their ToDo list by checking the "Hide Done Tasks" checkbox in the sidebar.
Completed tasks will be hidden, and users can view them by unchecking the checkbox.

6.Mark Tasks as Done: Users can mark tasks as completed by clicking on the checkbox next to the task in the ToDo list. 
Completed tasks will be visually distinguished from incomplete tasks.


Code Structure
The website's code is organized into separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. The HTML file (index.html) 
contains the structure of the website, including the header, navigation bar, and main content area. The CSS file (styles/style.css) contains the styling for the website, including fonts, colors, and layout. The JavaScript file (scripts/script.js) contains the functionality for adding, editing, deleting, filtering, and marking tasks as done.

The code is well-commented and follows best practices for readability and maintainability. The code is also organized into logical sections, making it easy to understand and modify.
